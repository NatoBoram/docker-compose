My personal homelab setup using Docker Compose.

To get started with your own homelab, take an hour to watch [Christian Lempa](https://youtube.com/@christianlempa)'s videos on Docker:

## Usage

Top-level folders represent a different machine in which Docker Compose is used to manage containers.

The machines are:

- [Corsair](./corsair) (dev machine)
- [Helion](./helion) (decommissioned)
- [Olea](./olea) (cloud server)
- [Phantom](./phantom) (current)

Each folder contains a `compose.yaml` that orchestrates the services running on that machine. The `compose.yaml` file loads services at `${service}/compose.yaml` and may expect overrides at `compose.override.yaml`. You'll have to read service definitions to see what needs to be overridden.

Each service has its own `.env.${service}` file. This is a template that contains all environment variables and their defaults for that service, with empty values serving as documentation. Copy that file to `.env.${service}.local` and fill in the actual values. The service compose files expect the `.env.${service}.local` file to exist and won't start without it.
